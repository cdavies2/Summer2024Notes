# Solution
A 1x2 domino will always cover two squares on a chessboard, one white and one black. If you remove the top right and bottom left corners from the board, there will not be an equal number of black and white squares. Therefore, covering the whole board with dominoes will be impossible, as there will always be two squares of one color left over
