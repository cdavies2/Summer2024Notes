# Central Dogma of Molecular Biology
* Deals with the flow of genetic information within a biological system.
* "DNA makes RNA, RNA makes protein"
* The central dogma also states that once information has passed into protein it cannot get out again. The transfer of information from nucleic acid to nucleic acid or from nucleic acid to protein may be possible, but transfer from protein to protein or protein to nucleic acid is impossible. "Information" refers to the precise determination of sequence, either of bases in nucleic acid or amino acid residues in protein.

## Biological Sequence Information
* The biopolymers that comprise DNA, RNA, and (poly)peptides are linear polymers (each monomer is connected to at most two other monomers). The sequence of the monomers transfers information.
* One biopolymer's sequence is used as a template for the construction of another biopolymer with a sequence that's entirely dependent on the original biopolymer's sequence
* DNA codes A, G, T, and C are transferred to RNA code U, C, A, and G respectively.
* The encoding of proteins is done in groups of three, known as codons.

## General Transfers of Biological Sequential Information
* General:
  * DNA -> DNA
  * DNA -> RNA
  * RNA -> Protein
* Special:
  * RNA -> DNA
  * RNA -> RNA
* Unknown
  * Protein -> DNA
  * Protein -> RNA
  * Protein -> Protein
  * DNA -> Protein

## DNA Replications
* DNA replication must occur if genetic material is to be provided for the progeny of any cell, so copying from DNA to DNA is the fundamental step in information transfer
* A complex group of proteins called the replisome replicates info from the parent strand to the complimentary daughter strand.

## Transcription
* Transcription is the process by which the information contained in a section of DNA is replicated in the form of a newly assembled piece of messenger RNA (mRNA)
* The product of the transcription process (adding a 5' cap and poly-A tail to the pre-mRNA chain and splicing) is a mature mRNA chain.

## Translation
* Mature mRNA is translated at a ribosome.
* Ribosomes read the mRNA triplet codons, usually beginning with an AUG (adenine-uracil-guanine) or initiator methionine codon downstream of the ribsome binding site.
* Each transfer RNA (tRNA) has anti-codons to match the codons on the mRNA.
* Translation ends with a stop codon which may be a UAA, UGA, UAG triplet
* The mRNA doesn't contain all the information for specifying the nature of a mature protein. The nascent polypeptide chain released from the ribosome commonly requires additional processing before the final product emerges. Fir most proteins, the folding process requires other chaperone proteins to control the form of the product.
* Some proteins need to be split into multiple sections without splicing, some polypeptide chains need to be cross-linked, and others must be attatched to cofactors such as haem (heme) before they become functional.

## Reverse Transcription
* Reverse transcription is the transfer of information from RNA to DNA (the reverse of normal transcription). This is known to occur in retroviruses (like HIV) and eukaryotes, like in the case of telomere synthesis.
* It is the process by which genetic information from RNA gets transcribed into new DNA

## RNA Replication
* RNA replication is the copying of one RNA to another. Many viruses replicate this way. The enzymes that copy RNA to new RNA are also found in many eukaryotes when they are involved in RNA silencing.
* RNA editing, in which in RNA sequence is altered by a complex of proteins and a "guide RNA" could also be seen as an RNA-to-RNA transfer.

## Direct Translation from DNA to Protein
* Direct translation from DNA to protein has been demonstrated in a cell-free system (in a test tube) using ribosome extracts from E. coli. These cell fragments could synthesize proteins from single-stranded DNA templates isolated from other organisms, but it was unclear whether this mechanism of translation corresponded specifically to the genetic code.

# Transfers of Information Not Explicitly Covered in the Theory
## Post-Translational Modification
* After protein amino acid sequences have been translated from nucleic acid chains, they can be edited by appropriate enzymes. There are not many clear examples where this has much to do with the central dogma

## Inteins
* An intein is a parasitic segment of a protein that can excise itself from the chain of amino acids as they emerge from the ribsome and rejoin the remaining portions with a peptide bond in such a manner that the main protein "backbone" doesn't fall apart.
* This is an example of protein directly editing DNA sequence, as well as increasing the sequence's heritable propagation.

## Methylation
* Variation in methylation states of DNA can alter gene expression levels significantly. Methylation variation usually occurs through the action of DNA methylases. When the change is heritable, it's considered epigenetic, and when it's not heritable, it would be a somatic epitype.

## Prions
* Prions are proteins of particular amino acid sequences in particular conformations. They propagate themselves in host celss by making conformational changes in other molecules of protein with the same amino acid sequence, but with a different conformation that is functionally important or detrimental to the organism.
* Some argue that prion-mediated inheritance violates the central dogma of molecular biology, but others argue that it doesn't, because the prion hypothesis doesn't claim that proteins replicate, but rather that there's a source of information within protein molecules that contributes to their biological function, and this information can be passed on to other molecules.
