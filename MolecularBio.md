# Central Dogma of Molecular Biology
* Deals with the flow of genetic information within a biological system.
* "DNA makes RNA, RNA makes protein"
* The central dogma also states that once information has passed into protein it cannot get out again. The transfer of information from nucleic acid to nucleic acid or from nucleic acid to protein may be possible, but transfer from protein to protein or protein to nucleic acid is impossible. "Information" refers to the precise determination of sequence, either of bases in nucleic acid or amino acid residues in protein.

## Biological Sequence Information
* The biopolymers that comprise DNA, RNA, and (poly)peptides are linear polymers (each monomer is connected to at most two other monomers). The sequence of the monomers transfers information.
* One biopolymer's sequence is used as a template for the construction of another biopolymer with a sequence that's entirely dependent on the original biopolymer's sequence
* DNA codes A, G, T, and C are transferred to RNA code U, C, A, and G respectively.
* The encoding of proteins is done in groups of three, known as codons.

## General Transfers of Biological Sequential Information
* General:
  * DNA -> DNA
  * DNA -> RNA
  * RNA -> Protein
* Special:
  * RNA -> DNA
  * RNA -> RNA
* Unknown
  * Protein -> DNA
  * Protein -> RNA
  * Protein -> Protein
  * DNA -> Protein

## DNA Replications
* DNA replication must occur if genetic material is to be provided for the progeny of any cell, so copying from DNA to DNA is the fundamental step in information transfer
* A complex group of proteins called the replisome replicates info from the parent strand to the complimentary daughter strand.

## Transcription
* Transcription is the process by which the information contained in a section of DNA is replicated in the form of a newly assembled piece of messenger RNA (mRNA)
* The product of the transcription process (adding a 5' cap and poly-A tail to the pre-mRNA chain and splicing) is a mature mRNA chain.

## Translation
* Mature mRNA is translated at a ribosome.
* Ribosomes read the mRNA triplet codons, usually beginning with an AUG (adenine-uracil-guanine) or initiator methionine codon downstream of the ribsome binding site.
* Each transfer RNA (tRNA) has anti-codons to match the codons on the mRNA.
* Translation ends with a stop codon which may be a UAA, UGA, UAG triplet
* The mRNA doesn't contain all the information for specifying the nature of a mature protein. The nascent polypeptide chain released from the ribosome commonly requires additional processing before the final product emerges. Fir most proteins, the folding process requires other chaperone proteins to control the form of the product.
* Some proteins need to be split into multiple sections without splicing, some polypeptide chains need to be cross-linked, and others must be attatched to cofactors such as haem (heme) before they become functional.

## Reverse Transcription
* Reverse transcription is the transfer of information from RNA to DNA (the reverse of normal transcription). This is known to occur in retroviruses (like HIV) and eukaryotes, like in the case of telomere synthesis.
* It is the process by which genetic information from RNA gets transcribed into new DNA
