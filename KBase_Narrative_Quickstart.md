# What is a Narrative?
* Narratices are shareable, reproducible workflows that include data, analysis steps, results, visualizations, and commentary.

# Steps to Create and Use the Features of Narratives
1. Create a New Narrative-click the "+ New Narrative" button in Narratives to open a new unitled narrative. A "Welcome to the Narrative Interface" box offers information and links to documentation for adding content to your Narrative. The "Narrative Tour" feature walks you through the user interface, pointing out various useful aspects of it.
2. Find Data to Analyze-to load data to your Narrative, click the "Add Data" button in the Data Panel, which can be found under the Analyze tab near the top left of the Narrative. The Data Browser will slide out with tabs that show several data sources. You can choose a dataset already in KBase by selecting any of the first four tabs, and the Import tab allows you to upload your own data (which is private unless you choose to share it)
3. Add Data to your Narrative-when you hover over a data object in the Data Browser, a blue "<Add" button will appear to its left, and click the button to add the data to your Narrative. Once you finish adding data, exit the Data Browser by clicking either the "Close" button at the bottom left of the browser window or the arrow at the top right of the Data Panel.
4. Choose an App-once you've added data to your Narrative, you can analyze it using one or more of the KBase apps listed in the App Panel below your data. To add an app to your Narrative from the App Panel, click on its name or icon. You can get more information about an app by hovering over it until "..." and clicking on it
5. Run the App-fill all the required fields in your app. "Smart" fields have a pulldown list of all the data objects from your Data Panel that you can choose from as input. When all required fields have been filled out, click the green "Run" button at the top left of the app cell to start the analysis.
6. Share Your Narrative-All Narratives that you create are private by default. You can make a Narrative public or share it with specific collaborators by clicking the "share" button near the top right of your Narrative.

## Access the Narrative Interface
* There are several ways to enter the Narrative Interface from KBase:
  * Use the menu at the top left of the landing page and select "Narrative Interface"
