# What is a Narrative?
* Narratices are shareable, reproducible workflows that include data, analysis steps, results, visualizations, and commentary.

# Steps to Create and Use the Features of Narratives
1. Create a New Narrative-click the "+ New Narrative" button in Narratives to open a new unitled narrative. A "Welcome to the Narrative Interface" box offers information and links to documentation for adding content to your Narrative. The "Narrative Tour" feature walks you through the user interface, pointing out various useful aspects of it.
2. Find Data to Analyze-to load data to your Narrative, click the "Add Data" button in the Data Panel, which can be found under the Analyze tab near the top left of the Narrative. The Data Browser will slide out with tabs that show several data sources. You can choose a dataset already in KBase by selecting any of the first four tabs, and the Import tab allows you to upload your own data (which is private unless you choose to share it)
3. Add Data to your Narrative-when you hover over a data object in the Data Browser, a blue "<Add" button will appear to its left, and click the button to add the data to your Narrative. Once you finish adding data, exit the Data Browser by clicking either the "Close" button at the bottom left of the browser window or the arrow at the top right of the Data Panel.
4. Choose an App-once you've added data to your Narrative, you can analyze it using one or more of the KBase apps listed in the App Panel below your data. To add an app to your Narrative from the App Panel, click on its name or icon. You can get more information about an app by hovering over it until "..." and clicking on it
5. Run the App-fill all the required fields in your app. "Smart" fields have a pulldown list of all the data objects from your Data Panel that you can choose from as input. When all required fields have been filled out, click the green "Run" button at the top left of the app cell to start the analysis.
6. Share Your Narrative-All Narratives that you create are private by default. You can make a Narrative public or share it with specific collaborators by clicking the "share" button near the top right of your Narrative.

# Narrative Navigator
* There are five tabs for exploring and locating existing Narratives: My Narratives, Shared with Me, Tutorials, and Public.

# Explore Data
## The Data Browser
* The Data Browser slide-out is accessed throught the right-facing arrow in the menu or the red "Add Data" button in the Data Pane.
 * My Data-data you've already loaded or analyzed in another Narrative
 * Shared with Me-data included in Narratives that have been shared with you
 * Public-data in KBase that's accessible to everyone
 * Example-example datasets that can be used as inputs to apps and methods
 * Import-mechanism allowing you to import your own data to your Narrative.
* If you hover over a data object in the Data Browser panel, three icons appear
   1. "<Add"-adds the data object to your Narrative
   2. Binoculars Icon-opens a Data Landing page
   3. Graph-like Icon-opens a Provenance page
 ## Information in the Data Pane
 * The Data Pane shows all the data that you've added to your Narrative. You can access more details about a particular data object by hovering over the object and clicking the "..." that appears in the right-hand side.
 * Page with three lines and folded corner-the "View Associated Report" button, opens the Data View report page for the data object.
 * Counter clockwise clock-the "View History to Revert Changes" icon, which allows you to see and revert to previous versions of the data.
 * Download icon-lets you download a data object to your local computer in JSON format
 * A-"Rename data", lets you rename your data object.
 * Trash can-delete data from your Narrative

# Data Viewers
* They can be accessed two ways from the Data Panel
  1. Click the name of a data object, and its viewer will be added to your Narrative
  2. Drag the object from the Data Panel and drop it into the main part of your Narrative
  * You can sort table entries by clicking on a column header to sort by that field, and clicking the same header again will reverse the sort order. You can sort by more than one column at a time by clicking one column header and shift-clicking other column headers.

# Data Landing and Provenance Pages
* Data Landing pages provide both known and contextual information about a data object, allowing users to examine various particulars about data, and compare it to other data objects. You will see a data object summary, a genome overview panel that lists information about the genome (biological domain, DNA length, etc), publications that mention this genome, taxonomic lineage, a species tree, functional categories, etc
* Provenance Pages-one way to facilitate reproducibility and transparency of scientific results. This page records and illustrates how data is derived and modified in KBase, including how it entered the system, whether it was produced through analysis of other objects, who generated the data, and when.
